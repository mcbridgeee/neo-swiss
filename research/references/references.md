# references

my research for this project pulled from a mix of visual inspiration, existing work, and style guides. most of the visual references came from pinterest boards focused on neo-swiss, neo-neo, and contemporary grid-heavy design. i also spent time looking at the **neo-neo** site to understand how people interpret this style in a web context instead of just in print.

neo neo: https://www.neoneo.ch/
type design: https://extraset.ch/

the screenshots in `/docs/process-screenshots/` also include some of the reference images i collected along the way. these helped me understand spacing, rhythm, and how strict the structure needs to be when applying this style digitally.

at first, i leaned toward the more expressive, museum-style neo-swiss work — the kind that lives on posters, signage, and large-format prints. but as i kept iterating, chatgpt helped me recognize that i needed to adapt those ideas into something that works as a **web-first** interpretation instead of treating the site like a gallery wall. that shift kept the layout cleaner and closer to what neo-swiss becomes when it moves online.

i also reviewed the professor’s public repo at:  
https://github.com/kaw393939/swiss_design_lineage_vibecoding  
this gave me a sense of how the structure and content were expected to look, and it helped shape the final direction of my layout and page hierarchy.

overall, the project was built from a mix of digital references, the class repo, chatgpt guidance, and the visual research in my screenshot folder. everything worked together to ground the site in the style without drifting too far into print-only aesthetics.
