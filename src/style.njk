  <h1 class="about-title">what is neo-swiss?</h1>

  <p class="about-intro">
    neo-swiss describes the continued evolution of the international
    typographic style into digital systems, responsive environments,
    and interface design. it carries the same foundations—grids,
    asymmetry, modularity, and typographic clarity—but adapts them
    to code-driven layouts and device standards.

    <h2 class="about-subtitle">roots in the swiss international style</h2>
    <p>
      mid-century designers such as josef müller-brockmann, emil ruder,
      armin hofmann, and max bill formalized a rational approach to layout
      built on grids, alignment, and structured typography. these methods
      shaped posters, signage, books, and corporate identity systems.

    <h2 class="about-subtitle">transition to digital systems</h2>
    <p>
      as interfaces moved from print to screens, swiss principles became the
      backbone of ui frameworks: baseline grids, modular spacing, fluid
      column systems, and type-driven hierarchy. css grid, flexbox, and
      responsive breakpoints mirror these earlier design logics.

    <h2 class="about-subtitle">neo-swiss today</h2>
    <p>
      contemporary teams use swiss principles to build design systems,
      dashboards, and products that emphasize readability, structure,
      rhythm, and reduction. the neo-swiss approach values clarity over
      ornament and relies on spacing, alignment, and typographic contrast
      to guide attention.

    layouts to kinetic, device-ready compositions—showing how each moment
    extends and reinterprets the swiss line.
