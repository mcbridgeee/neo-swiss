  <!-- INTRO -->
  <p class="about-intro">
    neo-swiss is the contemporary evolution of the international typographic
    style—reshaped for digital systems, responsive environments, and interface
    design. it preserves the foundations of swiss modernism—grids, asymmetry,
    modularity, and typographic clarity—while adapting them to flexible,
    code-driven layouts and device standards.

  <!-- ROOTS SECTION -->

    <h2 class="about-subtitle">roots in the swiss international style</h2>
    <p>
      mid-century designers such as josef müller-brockmann, emil ruder,
      armin hofmann, and max bill formalized a rational approach to layout
      grounded in grids, alignment, precision, and a stripped-down visual
      language. these principles shaped posters, signage systems, corporate
      identities, and influential design pedagogy.

  <!-- DIGITAL TRANSITION SECTION -->
  <div class="about-section">
    <h2 class="about-subtitle">transition to digital systems</h2>
    <p>
      as design shifted from print to screens, swiss methods became the backbone
      of ui frameworks: baseline grids, modular spacing, fluid columns, and
      clear typographic hierarchy. css grid, flexbox, responsive breakpoints,
      and design tokens echo these earlier structures.
    </p>

  <!-- TODAY SECTION -->
  <div class="about-section">
    <h2 class="about-subtitle">neo-swiss today</h2>
    <p>
      contemporary teams apply swiss logic to design systems, dashboards, and
      digital products that prioritize readability, structure, rhythm, and
      reduction. the neo-swiss approach values clarity over ornament and uses
      spacing, alignment, and contrast to guide attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      the swiss lineage gallery traces this movement from disciplined print grids
      to kinetic, device-ready compositions—showing how each moment extends and
      reinterprets the swiss line.
